I am mostly a CW QRP operator. I like to build my own antennas and deploy them on Parks on the Air activations, the work parking lot, or just wherever I happen to be.

I was first licensed as KE5ZUT as a sophomore in college in 2009 and quickly upgraded to General. I upgraded to Amateur Extra in 2010 as I was taking related engineering courses. I was involved with W5YJ, the Oklahoma State University radio club, for a while. Several of us helped revive the club after membership and involvement dwindled the late 2000's.

One of our first tasks was to take down a busted repeater from the Wentz dormitory elevator room. Bob Buford (W5RAB) helped our club get a grant to purchase a new VHF repeater that was installed in our shack on the fourth floor of Engineering South.

Then I graduated, took a job, got married, had kids. I took a long break from the hobby and picked it back up in 2020. This is when I got my current callsign AC5M. I started learning CW and purchased a MTR4b and an Elecraft KX2. I built my own EFHW and started attempting Parks on the Air activations. I also built a 20/30/40-meter linked dipole that I deploy on a 7.2 meter fiberglass telescopic fishing pole.

And then I took another break to move â€“ twice. Finally settled in at a nice home near where I originally grew up, I started working on CW again. In February 2024 I completed CWops CW Academy Fundamentals class led by Chris (KT9N) and John (AA5ND) with a great group of classmates. I learned and improved a lot under their guidance. I finally ditched the muscle memory copy I had developed from LCWO and started to grasp head copy. I am enrolled for the Intermediate class in May/June and am excited to keep improving my skills.
