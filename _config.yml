# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  Join me in exploring various aspects of amateur radio,

  the Air (SOTA) activities, and the techniques of QRP for
  efficient low-power communication.
